# Introdunction 
These are exercises for the course **Image Processing and Analysis** at **Ecole Centrale de Nantes**, France, taught by **Prof. Diana MATEUS LAMUS**, to whom I am very grateful for the very detailed course and the jupyter notebook exercises (all rights reserved)

The course will focus on:
1. Introduction to digital images
2. Morphological operators
3. Spatial filtering
4. Spectral filtering
5. Geometric transformations
6. Segmentation methods

All exercises are done in python, using libraries such as numpy, scipy and skimage.

# Run
You can clone or download the code and images directly to run jupyter notebook. The default path in the code is the folder 'images' containing all images in the same directory as the jupyter notebook, you can change this default path in the code.
